# Desktop-Search-Engine

It is a desktop search engine which allows to hunting the most relevant documents for any search. It was my minor project of B.Tech. in Fall 2013. I named this project "Khoji". 

There can be hundreds or thousands of documents present in a computer and Khoji-search brings the most relevant of those to the users according to their need.

Khoji-search ranks the documents based on Vector space model of Information Retrieval. The ranking scheme used is a modified version of Term-Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF*IDF). Khoji is written in Java and it is implemented on Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
